        Also known as “African Chanel No. 5”, Bint-El-Sudan translates to “daughter of Sudan”. The perfume was made in 1920 by Eric Burgess, a British adventurer. The perfume was advertised by hanging colorful posters in North African cities. It was first sold to African pilgrims on their way to Mecca and  was also used as a currency in trans-Saharan trade. The popularity and success of the perfume is associated not only with its smell but also the perfume’s association with progressiveness. The bottle of the perfume shows a naked woman from Nigeria where strict islamic law was in place.

Like other fragrances in ancient Egypt, kyphi was a sacred scent that was used to honor and perfume the deceased.

The best-selling luxury body care company with a Brazil-inspired aesthetic was established in 2015 as a result of a relationship Brazilian native Camila Pierotti made with American expats Heela Yang and Marc Capra. The three became close because of their shared experiences with the nation and its distinctive view of beauty. The body care, hair care, and scent items from the brand are practically a Rio beach in a bottle.

The scent of the Bum Bum Cream became so popular that people wanted a perfume out of it. It was then developed as a fine fragrance separate from the cream. It stands out because it's sophisticated but there's still an element of yumminess and deliciousness to it. Now Sol de Janeiro makes sure all of their scents have a gourmand element to it and can also be worn on its own as a fine fragrance.

      Since its debut in 2006, Tom Ford's Black Orchid fragrance has become a cult favorite in the perfume industry. Black Orchid is a favorite with everyone, from wealthy businessmen to downtown cool girls. It lies in between the lure of primal sensuality and vintage glamor. At first whiff, the perfume is opulent, exotic, and downright tempting. However, as its many fans can attest, as it interacts with your body chemistry, it changes into a velvety blend of musk and sandalwood that doesn't feel particularly masculine or feminine; rather, it just feels opulent.

      Indian Fragrances has long been a thriving center for the trading of aromatics. In India, attar has been around for more than 60,000 years. The ancient Indian epics and Granths make reference to smell and perfume. The rulers would use fragrance to start their day. According to the "Agni Purana," they would bathe in more than 150 different perfumes. The Indus culture, which lasted from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, also had scent and perfumery.

Probably the most well-known essential oil is rose tar. The perfume of rose (Gulab) ittar prevents depression and gives the user vigor. The rose is regarded as "The Queen of Flowers" in Ayurveda because of its romantic and feminine qualities, which are thought to represent unadulterated love. The aroma is in fact reminiscent of freshly cut roses with a foundation of pure sandalwood.

      Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, born in 384 BC. In his books De Anima Book II and De Sensu  he extensively talks about the human senses. Aristotle regards the sense of smell to be the most obscure sense that humans possess. He premises his argument on the fact that many other animals have a sense  of smell which is much stronger than the sense of smell of humans. Aristotle also points out how smell and taste are comparable but scents are intrinsically more vague than tastes. 
He also points out in his book that the medium for scent is not air or water, but rather something transparent that both of these media share.

        Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher born in 1724. Kant described the human senses to be the intuition we possess when an object is present. He classified the human senses into objective and subjective senses. Objective senses, according to his classification, provide us with more knowledge of the object while subjective senses provide us with more “enjoyment” of  the object. 
 
        <br>Kant declared the sense of smell to be a more subjective scent. He established a deep connection between taste and smell as both are affected by salt (either salt dissolved by the fluids in air or the mouth).
         
        <br>The most replaceable sense that humans have, according to popular belief, is scent, but Kant challenges this notion and offers numerous evidences indicating the contrary. In addition to its impacts on appetite or aspects like defense against toxic air, the sense of smell has profound social and cognitive implications on people. In contrast to other objective senses Kant labels smell as a "social" sense.

The Song of Songs is about love and uses the five senses to depict the sensation of erotic love. Throughout the song the sense of smell plays a vital role in depicting the extent and nature of love to the reader. For instance, a lover is likened to a sachet of perfume in the poem. While in other situations, the author makes allusions to scented oils and  perfumed bedsheets, creating a strong connection between the sense of smell and romance.
